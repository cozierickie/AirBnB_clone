# 0x00.AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Functions of this command interpreter:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.12.2). The text editors used were vim and Visual Studio Code (version 1.87)

## Description
As part of the ALX Software Engineer program, this team project marks the initial stride in crafting our inaugural full-scale web application, an Airbnb clone. This initial phase involves developing a bespoke command-line interface for data management and establishing the foundational classes for data storage.

## Console and Command Usage
The console is a Unix shell-like command line user interface provided by the python CmdModule. It prints a prompt and waits for the user for input, for our project we used (hbnb).

| Command                               | Example         |
| ------------------------------------- |---------------|
| Display commands help                 | (hbnb) help     |
| Create object (prints its id)         | (hbnb) create   |
| Destroy object                        | (hbnb) destroy or (hbnb) .destroy() |
| Show object                           | (hbnb) show or (hbnb) .show() |
| Show "all" objects or instances class | (hbnb) all or (hbnb) all |
| Run console                           | ./console.py    |
